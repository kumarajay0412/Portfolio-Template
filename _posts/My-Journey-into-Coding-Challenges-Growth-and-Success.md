## Beginning at IIIT Delhi

I remember vividly my first day at IIIT Delhi on July 20, 2019. After a year off, I had no confidence left and felt overwhelmed by the talented people around me. During our week-long induction, which included various activities and a talent night, I realized I had no noticeable talents. There was also an introductory programming class where I couldn't grasp a single concept in Python.

In my first semester, I struggled with courses that required coding, such as Introduction to Programming, barely passing with a 6 CGPA. I understood the concepts but couldn't complete the assignments or labs. The following semester brought Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), and I was failing miserably until COVID-19 shifted everything online, allowing me to pass—barely.

## Diving into Competitive Programming

As the pandemic continued, everyone was intrigued by CP codechef and codeforces i tried that too. everyone around me was doing great able to solve multiple questions but I was not able to solve many questions always able to solve not more than 2 questions . I remember I gave around 50 contests and consulted senior friends but was not progressing at that time During this time, I took a frontend course on Coursera. Although it was somewhat dull, I enjoyed it and even developed a project called CovidTracker, which I was immensely proud of. It was the first time I felt competent in something.

## My First Internship

Then came the 4th semester; my CGPA was improving a lot—of course, it was online and everyone was cheating, but I wasn't learning anything. I wish I could have studied more. During that time, I tried doing UI/UX, did some freelancing, and even applied for internships in design, as I had a good grasp of UI/UX subjects in college. I thought, "Let's try it," but I failed miserably. Then, in April 2021, I emailed my professor in desperation asking if I could get some work under him. After mailing him five times, I finally got a reply, and he offered me an internship after a take-home assignment at Tweek Labs. It was my first internship, and I earned ₹5000 per month. I felt on top of the world, being the first in my group to get an internship. I was fortunate to have such a supportive group. I didn't have any expectations from the college internship drive, as I thought I wasn't good enough and I hadn't prepared at all. However, I was preparing at my own pace, doing LeetCode, and revising DSA, and then I got an interview at one of the good companies that came to college, Mathworks. I cracked it and got an internship at Mathworks. I remember it was the only company that had a group discussion round. I had an internship at a startup where I loved my work, working on React Native and making a great app for iOS my app also got displayed on Shark Tank

## Juggling Multiple Internships

In July 2021, I secured an internship at a company in London. They were not paying much, but ₹15,000 was a considerable amount for a fifth-semester student. I worked there for 10 months, focusing extensively on frontend development and learning many aspects of it in depth. At the same time, I contacted a professor in college who was impressed by my resume and offered me an internship in the lab for ₹10,000 per month. Earning ₹25,000 was a significant achievement for me. I continued working at both the startup and managing my college responsibilities. I was completely packed with no free time; my friends supported me in every subject, and I succeeded because of them.

## International internship opportunity

In March 2023, I applied randomly for an internship position in Tokyo and received an interview call. I underwent three rounds within a week, and astonishingly, I received an offer on the day my internship at Mathworks started. The offer was financially attractive; everything was sponsored by the company, including flights and accommodation. I was one of the few students in my batch to secure such an opportunity off-campus. However, there was a dilemma as the internship in Tokyo conflicted with my college semester, and my Mathworks internship, which was going well, featured excellent managers and mentors and provided me with new learning opportunities. At the end of my Mathworks internship, I passed an exit interview primarily focused on data structures and algorithms and received a full-time job offer at Mathworks Bangalore—a dream for any student.

After much deliberation with the placement cell, I decided to take a semester break and proceed with the Tokyo internship for three months. The day I landed in Tokyo was monumental; I was greeted at the airport by two people holding a banner with my name, which was an incredible welcome.

Living in Japan was an experience unto itself; it's hard to fully capture the essence of it. For the first time in my life, I lived alone, cooked my meals, made many new friends, explored numerous places, and engaged in various activities. I was deeply moved by how welcoming the Japanese people were. I enjoyed working there, learned technologies like Go, Next.js, and gRPC, and collaborated with a multicultural team. I plan to write a separate blog about my experiences in Japan. Unfortunately, the company later decided that the business my team was working on was not profitable, leading to its shutdown, and I did not receive a return offer. Additionally, while in Japan, I faced rejections from Amazon in the second round and Headout in the first round, marking one of the lowest points in my life. However, these setbacks did not overly affect me, thanks to the support of great friends and my belief in myself. Afterward, I joined a startup in Gurgaon Briefly for three months. Although the experience wasn’t great, I never minded much.

## Starting a Career at Gan.ai

Before heading to Japan, the founder of Gan.ai reached out to me about a job opportunity. I attended some interviews but didn't hear back. I persistently messaged the founder on LinkedIn. Surprisingly, he called me at 1 a.m. and scheduled another interview. The next day, I had an interview with the Gan.ai team but didn’t perform well. I reached out again, asking for another chance. They invited me for an in-office round, and this time, I was selected. They offered me an internship with a substantial stipend, although it required me to be in the office three times a week. During this in-office internship, I fell in love with the product, was assigned many rewarding projects, made numerous friends, and was eventually offered a full-time position. Consequently, I decided to reject the offer from Mathworks and chose to start my career with Gan.ai. It was a tough decision to begin my career at a startup, but I wanted to take the chance, and I did.
